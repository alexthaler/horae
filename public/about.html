		<h2>WTH is a Horae?</h2>

		<br>
		TLDR:  Basically the Horae were the godesses of seasonality and time.  I started working on this app because the gf was waiting for a train that only ran when trains were going to Ravinia (I'm still not sure why) and had an old schedule.  This was during winter so after google for greek gods of time it seemed fitting to name it after the goddesses of the seasons.

		<h2>For why?</h2>
		First of all because the metra trains are very rarely right on time with it's schedule.  That being the case and me being rather used to the live CTA system where I know exactly when the next train should be arriving I couldn't take it anymore and started using the beta live tracker on metras website.  However, I'm a stickler for optimization especially when it comes to touches on a phone screen.  So after many months of using the metra website on my iPhone I figured I could make it a little easier to get to and save links to the live updated information.

		<br>
		Thus Horae was born.

		<h2>Contact/App Info</h2>
		All train information is supplied by metrarail.com and I make no claim that I create, own or am responsible for any of that data. This service is just to put a slightly prettier face on it while the service is in beta.
